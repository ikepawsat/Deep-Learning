As you saw in the linear_classifier notebook, deriving and implementing the gradient of even a very simple model can be time-consuming and potentially error-prone.

        "\n",
        "PyTorch provides the `nn.Module` API for you to define arbitrary network architectures, while tracking every learnable parameter for you. In Part II, we implemented SGD ourselves. PyTorch also provides the `torch.optim` package that implements all the common optimizers, such as RMSProp, Adagrad, and Adam. You can refer to the [doc](http://pytorch.org/docs/master/optim.html) for the exact specifications of each optimizer.\n",

        "1. Subclass `nn.Module`. Give your network class an intuitive name like `TwoLayerFC`.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. In the constructor `__init__()`, define all the layers you need as class attributes. Layer objects like `nn.Linear` and `nn.Conv2d` are themselves `nn.Module` subclasses and contain learnable parameters, so that you don't have to instantiate the raw tensors yourself. `nn.Module` will track these internal parameters for you. Refer to the [doc](http://pytorch.org/docs/master/nn.html) to learn more about the dozens of builtin layers. **Warning**: don't forget to call the `super().__init__()` first!\n",
        "\n",
        "3. In the `forward()` method, define the *connectivity* of your network. You should use the attributes defined in `__init__` as function calls that take tensor as input and output the \"transformed\" tensor. Do *not* create any new layers with learnable parameters in `forward()`! All of them must be declared upfront in `__init__`.\n",
        "\n",

You can use the check_accuracy and train functions from above. You can use either `nn.Module` or `nn.Sequential` API.\n",

        "- **Filter size**: Above we used 5x5; would smaller filters be more efficient?\n",
        "- **Number of filters**: Above we used 32 filters. Do more or fewer do better?\n",
        "- **Pooling vs Strided Convolution**: Do you use max pooling or just stride convolutions?\n",
        "- **Batch normalization**: Try adding spatial batch normalization after convolution layers and vanilla batch normalization after affine layers. Do your networks train faster? See https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.BatchNorm2d.html\n",
        "- **Network architecture**: The network above has two layers of trainable parameters. Can you do better with a deep network? Good architectures to try include:\n",
        "    - [conv-relu-pool]xN -> [affine]xM -> [softmax]\n",
        "    - [conv-relu-conv-relu-pool]xN -> [affine]xM -> [softmax]\n",
        "    - [batchnorm-relu-conv]xN -> [affine]xM -> [softmax]\n",
        "- **Global Average Pooling**: Instead of flattening and then having multiple affine layers, perform convolutions until your image gets small (7x7 or so) and then perform an average pooling operation to get to a 1x1 image picture (1, 1 , Filter#), which is then reshaped into a (Filter#) vector. This is used in [Google's Inception Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.00567) (See Table 1 for their architecture).\n",

        "### Tips for training\n",
        "For each network architecture that you try, you should tune the learning rate and other hyperparameters. When doing this there are a couple important things to keep in mind:\n",
        "\n",
        "- If the parameters are working well, you should see improvement within a few hundred iterations\n",
        "- Remember the coarse-to-fine approach for hyperparameter tuning: start by testing a large range of hyperparameters for just a few training iterations to find the combinations of parameters that are working at all.\n",
        "- Once you have found some sets of parameters that seem to work, search more finely around these parameters. You may need to train for more epochs.\n",
        "- You should use the validation set for hyperparameter search, and save your test set for evaluating your architecture on the best parameters as selected by the validation set.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Going above and beyond\n",
        "If you are feeling adventurous there are many other features you can implement to try and improve your performance. You are **not required** to implement any of these, but don't miss the fun if you have time!\n",
        "\n",
        "- Alternative optimizers: you can try Adam, Adagrad, RMSprop, etc.\n",
        "- Alternative activation functions such as leaky ReLU, parametric ReLU, ELU, or MaxOut.\n",
        "- Model ensembles\n",
        "- Data augmentation\n",
        "- New Architectures\n",
        "  - [ResNets](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385) where the input from the previous layer is added to the output.\n",
        "  - [DenseNets](https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.06993) where inputs into previous layers are concatenated together.\n",
        "  - [This blog has an in-depth overview, although the code uses Tensorflow](https://chatbotslife.com/resnets-highwaynets-and-densenets-oh-my-9bb15918ee32)\n",

First thing I did is change the filter size to 3x3 instead of 5x5. In class we discussed that doing a 3x3 filter is the same as a 5x5 by adding another layer with another non-linearization function. By doing this combined with drop out I can make the model overfit less and over 10 epochs this seemed to be the best idea to me. I tried using different drop out rates and no drop out rates but ultimately landed on these values. Additionally after our class discussion I added Batch Normalization."
